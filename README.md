# Frontend Practice Projects 🚀

This repository is a collection of frontend practice projects designed to strengthen my skills in building modern, interactive web applications. The projects emphasize real-world functionality, API integration, complex data rendering, and AI-powered features.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React** – Component-based UI development
- **Vite** – Fast, modern build tool and development server
- **React Query** – Data fetching, caching, and state management for async operations
- **Zustand** – Lightweight and scalable global state management
- **AI Integration** – Experimenting with OpenAI APIs and custom AI utilities
- **REST APIs** – Consuming and interacting with external and internal APIs

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Mastering **React** fundamentals and advanced patterns
- Learning to **communicate with APIs** and handle real-world data
- Building **AI-enhanced UI interactions**
- Implementing **state management** with simplicity and scalability
- Rendering **complex nested data structures** cleanly and efficiently
- Writing clean, maintainable, and **performant frontend code**

## 🌐 API Sources

I’ll be using publicly available APIs from the [public-apis GitHub repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) to explore real-world data and interactions.

## 💡 Goal

To build a solid foundation in frontend development by applying modern tools and patterns, with a focus on real-world usability and future scalability. This is also a space to document experiments with emerging web tech and AI integrations.
