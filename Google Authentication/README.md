# 🔐 Custom Authentication

A project focused on building a complete custom authentication system **without relying on third-party auth libraries**. It explores the entire flow—from user sign-up and account verification to login and session management—while also supporting social login (Google).

## ✨ Features

- Fully custom-built authentication flow (no external auth libraries)
- Form components designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind
- Efficient onboarding experience: sign up → email verification → login
- Token-based authentication with protected routes
- Google OAuth integration as an alternative sign-in method

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** – Component-driven UI development
- **Vite** – Fast and modern build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design
- **Zustand** – Lightweight global state management

### Backend

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for scalable backend logic
- **Express.js** – Minimal and flexible framework for RESTful APIs
- **Custom Authentication** – Manual implementation of signup, login, verification, and session/token handling

## 💡 Goal

To deeply understand and demonstrate how authentication systems work under the hood—without relying on packages like Firebase Auth or Auth0. This project serves as a practical guide to building secure, user-friendly authentication flows from scratch, including support for social login. It's ideal for learning core backend security concepts, token/session handling, and integrating authentication cleanly into a modern frontend stack.
